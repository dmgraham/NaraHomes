**(3) Simplifications**

* assuming bedrooms and bathrooms search is exact number
and not a range
* Assuming no den's for simplicity
* Search results should be paginated
* Dark mode is a better default because it looks better
* Property listings only have 1 image

(4) What I would add
* A paginator for the search results and featured listings
